# Restaurant POS System - Food Ordering Module

Hello everyone,  
I am Yash, and I'd like to introduce you to our Restaurant POS System's Food Ordering Module.

## üì± Brief Description

This application is a food ordering module designed specifically for a POS (Point of Sale) system. It enables restaurant staff to browse the menu, add items to the cart, adjust quantities, and place orders efficiently. The app is built using React Native, ensuring a smooth experience on both iOS and Android devices.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Menu Navigation:** Browse and select menu items organized by categories.
- **Cart Management:** Add items to the cart, adjust quantities, and remove items as needed.
- **Order Summary:** Review and place orders with a detailed summary of the items in the cart.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Responsive design that works seamlessly on both iOS and Android devices.
- **Backend Integration:** Integration with a mock backend API using Strapi for data management.

## üóÇ Folder Structure & Styling

### Folder Structure

The app is organized using the **Atomic Design methodology** (Organism methodology), which breaks down the UI into independent, reusable components. This structure is highly beneficial for scaling the project, ensuring maintainability, and promoting consistency across the application.

- **atoms:** Basic building blocks like buttons, text inputs, and icons.
- **molecules:** Combinations of atoms working together, such as form fields or a card with an image and text.
- **organisms:** More complex UI elements composed of molecules and atoms, like a menu list or a cart summary.
- **appComponents:** Layouts that arrange organisms to form pages.
- **screen:** Final views rendered to the user.
- **adapters:** This directory contains modules responsible for managing external connections, such as APIs or third-party services. It acts as an interface between the app and external data sources, ensuring a clean separation of concerns and making it easier to swap out or update integrations without affecting the core application logic.
- **state:** : This folder houses the application's state management logic, including slices and API fetching functions. Slices define individual pieces of state and their corresponding reducers, while API fetching functions handle data retrieval from external sources. This structure promotes organized and maintainable state management, allowing for scalable and efficient handling of the application's data flow.

### Styling

For styling, I've used a combination of **React Native's default styling options** and **Tailwind CSS** (via NativeWind), providing a clean, modern, and responsive design. This hybrid approach leverages the strengths of both libraries, offering flexibility and efficiency in styling components.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

To get started with the application, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Install Node Modules

Open your terminal, navigate to the app's root directory, and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 2: Start the Metro Server

Metro Bundler is the JavaScript bundler that ships with React Native. Start it by running:

```bash
npm start
```

This command will start the Metro Bundler in a terminal window. Let it continue running while you develop your application.

### Step 3: Start Your Application

With Metro Bundler running, open a new terminal in the root of your React Native project. Depending on your development environment, use the following commands to run the app on an Android Emulator or iOS Simulator.

#### For iOS:

```bash
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

#### For Android:

```bash
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

If everything is set up correctly, your new app should appear on your Android Emulator or iOS Simulator shortly. Alternatively, you can also run the app directly from within Android Studio or Xcode.

### Troubleshooting:

If you encounter any issues, ensure that your Android Emulator or iOS Simulator is correctly configured and that all dependencies are installed.

## üìö Additional Information

### Design Choices

The app's UI/UX design is centered around ease of use, with a clean and modern interface. Tailwind CSS was chosen for its utility-first approach, allowing for rapid development and responsive design. The Atomic Design methodology ensures that the app is modular and scalable, making future enhancements easier to implement.

### Backend Integration

The app uses **Strapi** as a mock backend API. Strapi provides endpoints for retrieving menu items, categories
